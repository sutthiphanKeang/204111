Lexus has created the world's first drivable cardboard car. This one-off life-size model replica of Toyota's new IS Saloon is crafted in precision-cut cardboard using the origami technique. Weve never heard of this things being done before. Weve heard of scaled versions of this, possibly, but nothing to this scale where someone could actually enter the car and move it backwards and forwards. I think its something special weve done here. The design comes with a fully fitted interior, functioning doors, headlights and rolling wheels. Difficult words: one-off (done only once), craft (to make something using a special skill), precision (done in a very exact way), scaled (smaller), scale (size).

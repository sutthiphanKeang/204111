This news is from Australia!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. A race is held there. It is only for solar cars. The cars travel 3,000 kilometres. They go from Darwin to Adelaide. A 1,000-watt car can complete the trip in just 50 hours. There are 47 teams this year. This solar race is the biggest solar vehicle event in the world. Difficult words: race (a situation when people go fast and try to win against other people), solar (relating to the sun), vehicle (a thing like a car).
